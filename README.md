# Tomato-leaf-image-classification
Classifies tomato leaf diseases using 350 handcrafted features (color, texture, shape, frequency) and an SVM classifier with GridSearchCV. No deep learning used. Includes feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and optional Random Forest analysis for feature importance.
